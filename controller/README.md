# LED controller

## What is this?

This is a multiplatform app you can use to controll your LED stip.

## Installation

### Build from source

Since this is a flutter app you will need to install flutter.

1. go to this folder
2. fill in the `.env` file (there is a `.env.example`)
3. run `flutter run --release`

Note that for iOS apps it will be nessesary to sighn the application. If there occurs any problem, feel free to open an issue and I will explain in more detail how to do so.
